    "You roll a coin and you move one step ahead if you get head and two step ahead if you get tail. \n",
    "The game ends when you reach Boardwalk (passing is not ok).\n",
    "Square 12 is “Go to Jail,” which sends you to square 4. You immediately get out of jail.\n",
    "There are two Chance squares at 2 and 10 (diamonds on the graph) where you draw a card,\n",
    "which can send you to another square. The card is picked (with replacement) from a deck\n",
